# Pipeline for Data Engineering
1. In this project, we fetch real time data from an API in JSON format
2. Store that data into a csv
3. Create [data model](https://github.com/paramshah31/basic-data-pipeline/blob/main/datamodel.png) to avoid redundancy & store different types of data like images, nested JSON
4. Perform data pre-processing & transformation
5. Finally, store the data on AWS
